# Google-Advanced-Data-Analytics-Capstone

This project utilizes data analytics to determine the reasons for employee attrition in a company. Data analysis was conducted using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, and seaborn, followed by the creation of a logistic regression model.


# Project Objectives
To understand the attrition rates of employees within the company and identify potential reasons for attrition.

To determine which factors influence employees' decisions to leave and analyze these factors.


# Project Contents

Data Exploration and Cleaning: In the initial step, the dataset was examined, missing or incorrect data was cleaned, and data exploration was conducted.

Data Analysis: Detailed analyses were performed on the dataset, examining employee attrition rates and identifying relationships between factors.

Model Building: A machine learning model, specifically a logistic regression model, was created to predict the risk of employee attrition.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the created model was evaluated, and metrics such as accuracy rate were analyzed.
